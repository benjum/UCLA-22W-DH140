## Course Description
Coding is a skill.  Coding is an art.  Coding is a tool for creating other forms of expression, web sites, video games, music, and graphic visualizations of the flow of information and ideas.  Coding has produced products that unify people, separate people, reinforce love, reinforce prejudice, entertain, bore, destroy, propagandize, and calm.  Coding has had an undeniable impact on the modern world.  This course will introduce you to coding through the language of Python.

On the one hand, the course will develop your fluency in Python and general coding skills.  We will learn how to speak grammatically correct Python to the computer, we will learn about Python in the context of other languages, we will learn how to use libraries of Python code, and we will learn how to use Python to tell stories of our own.  On the other hand, the course will expose you to ways that Python can be used in the humanities. During our hands-on experiences gaining Python fluency, we’ll look at examples that include (but are not limited to) identifying patterns in literature, recommending new music to your friends, mapping urban inequities, and analyzing social networks.

## Learning Outcomes

During this course, you will:

* Develop proficiency with the programming language Python and with the tools that support code development and practice
* Demonstrate the value of data for discovery, exploration, and analysis
* Gain expertise in coding and data science practice and research
* Apply Python to critically describe, analyze, and visualize data in the context of the humanities

## Course materials & technology

The course materials will consist primarily of Jupyter Notebooks and online readings. The only technology requirement on your part is access to a web browser.

**Jupyter Notebooks:** All class notebooks will accessible on the web at [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/benjum/UCLA-22W-DH140). You will be able to run them all on the [IDRE JupyterHub](https://jupyter.idre.ucla.edu/) – this is a customized coding environment that is accessible via the web.

**Online Readings:** Each week there will be several readings of online content. These will provide context and stimulus for our coding activities.

**Canvas:** Assignment submissions, quizzes, and discussions will take place on the Canvas course site, accessible at [bruinlearn.ucla.edu](https://bruinlearn.ucla.edu).

## Evaluation

### Grading Breakdown

| Graded Activities | Percentage | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Discussion Posts | 10% | Ten total discussion posts |
| Quizzes | 5% | Ten total quizzes |
| Assignments | 60% | Ten total assignments <br> (8 weekly + 2 final-project-related ) |
| Final Project | 25% | Culminating project demonstrating concepts learned throughout course |

### Discussion Posts

For each week’s assigned readings, I will post a prompt or question(s) on Canvas, and you will be required to submit a short discussion post in response to it on Canvas by Sunday (11:59pm) before class. The post should be thoughtful and substantive but relatively brief, just a few sentences up to two paragraphs max in length. You’ll get full marks for completing a post that is on-topic. These posts are simply intended to get you thinking about the material. You are also strongly encouraged to read and respond to the posts of your peers, and we will discuss readings in the class after postings have been made.

### Quizzes

There will be short quizzes in class each week to reinforce the interactive exercises we’re doing. These are not intended to be stressful, they are intended to help you make sure that you are learning the correct concepts. You will be scored on number of correct answers, but you will be able to retake the quiz as many times as you want before the end of the following day (Tuesday at 11:59pm).

### Assignments

Assignments will be the majority portion of your grade and consist of coding exercises, short answer questions that reflect on content, and preliminary work to get you moving smoothly towards your culminating final project.

They will be graded according to the following criteria:

* **Does it work?:** Unless you purposefully created code cells that produce errors to make a point, notebook assignments must run from top to bottom without any errors. Verify this by restarting the kernel and running all cells.
* **Does it work correctly?:** It’s possible to write code that runs ok but does not produce the intended results. The code should be bug-free.
* **Cleanliness:** Nobody wants to go through unreadable code! Make sure to document your work accordingly, providing markdown cells and comments throughout.
* **Thinking out of the box:** It is easy to copy an existing notebook and replace datasets and parameters to fulfill an assignment, but how well have you grasped the underlying concepts? This can be demonstrated by *applying* your skills in new ways rather than *copying* each step of a given assignment. For example, you may experiment with functions not demonstrated in class, or create your own workflow that borrows certain concepts learned in class to make them your own.

### Final Project

Your final project will revolve around a humanities-related topic of your choice. You will choose supporting datasets of interest, complete an exploratory data analysis, apply at least one of the coding methods that we discuss in class, and craft a narrative that presents conclusions drawn from the data. The final product will be a webpage report (1500+ words, not including figure captions) and a very short (~3-5 minute) presentation of your analysis.

If you would like to work in groups of 2 or 3 on your final project, that is great. We will discuss everyone’s project interests and the possibility of team formation when the time comes. For teams, do note that I will expect more substantial content and a clear description from all team members as to the role of each person in the final product.

## Policies

Assignments, quizzes, and discussion posts

* These will become available in the Canvas Modules area on Mondays.
* Quizzes are due by 11:59pm on the Tuesday following class.
* Assignments and discussion posts are due by 11:59pm on the Sunday before the next class.
* All material should be submitted through Canvas.

Grading Policies

* Assignment grades will be posted by the Friday after their due date.
* If you have a question about your grade, please contact me immediately. I will respond to inquiries within 48 hours.

Late Work

* I will be very lenient with deadlines.
  * We are starting out with 2 zoom meetings and there will be 2 Monday holidays, and in the present environment, I don't want to create consternation in keeping up with the course, let alone any external demands you may have.
* If you can not submit something on time, simply send me an email telling me when you'll submit the assignment.
* Final projects are due by the day of the final.
  * I will be less lenient with this deadline, but if external circumstances prevent you from completing the final project, send me an email to schedule a time that we can discuss your situation in-person (or via Zoom) so that we can work something out.

## Weekly Schedule

**Note:** Weekly content is subject to change and will be modified as needed based on class discussions, needs, and progress.

## How to ask a technical question

Given the nature of the course, you will have many, many questions along the way. However, please adhere to the following guidelines in order to make consultations as productive as possible. Students who do not follow these guidelines will be asked to reschedule.

Before asking a question:

1. Close all open programs, restart your computer, then try your task again
1. Search google and stackoverflow for the topic/problem (for example, the name of the function you’re struggling with or the error message you are seeing)
1. Go back through the relevant lecture materials to look for any insights
1. Go back through the assigned reading materials to look for any insights

If the above steps haven’t solved your problem, send an email (or attend office hours) and include the following information:

1. A detailed description of what you’re trying to do, why, and how
1. A complete [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) of your code so far (never send screenshots of code)
1. What you’ve already tried to do to solve your problem and what you have learned from it (specifically, explain the results of steps 1-4 above, including relevant links from stackoverflow etc)

## Academic Integrity

UCLA is a community of scholars. In this community, we are all responsible for maintaining standards of academic honesty. As a member of the University community, you are expected to demonstrate integrity in your academic endeavors. You are evaluated on your own merits. I encourage interaction whil learning the material, but cheating, plagiarism, collaborative work on written assignments such that you are sharing answers, or other kinds of academic dishonesty are unacceptable and may result in formal disciplinary proceedings, which may result in suspension or dismissal.

**Don’t take chances.** Ask me if you are unclear about UCLA policy. Ignorance is NO defense. In addition, avoid placing yourself in situations which might lead me to suspect you of cheating.

**Alternatives to dishonest behavior:**

* **Seek out help.** Talk with me to see if there is special tutoring or other arrangements to be made.
* **Drop the course.** Can you take it again in the future when you might feel more prepared or less pressured?
* **See a counselor.** UCLA has many resources for students who are feeling the stresses of academic and personal pressures.

You have worked very hard to get here, so don’t cheat! You don’t need to. If you would like more information, please see the Dean of Students’ Office in 1206 Murphy Hall, call (310) 825-3871, or visit their website at www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu.

## Student Resources for Support and Learning

**Providing feedback to me:** I encourage your feedback at any time throughout the quarter about things that are helping you learn, or things that aren’t helping. Please communicate with me if there are ways that we can improve the course.

**Personal problems:** Sometimes, factors out of our control make it difficult to focus on schoolwork. If you are having a personal problem that affects your participation, please talk to me so we can create a plan. If you are not comfortable speaking with me directly, please utilize the other student resources provided below in order to understand how to best approach success in this course given your personal needs. Please do not wait until the end of the quarter to share any challenges that have negatively impacted you. The sooner we meet, the more options we will have to support your overall academic success.

**Academic accomodations based on a disability:** If you are already registered with the Center for Accessible Education (CAE), please request your Letter of Accommodation on the Student Portal. If you are seeking registration with the CAE, please submit your request for accommodations via the CAE website. Please note that the CAE does not send accommodations letters to instructors–you must request that I view the letter in the online Faculty Portal. Once you have requested your accommodations via the Student Portal, please notify me immediately so I can view your letter. Students with disabilities requiring academic accommodations should submit their request for accommodations as soon as possible, as it may take up to two weeks to review the request.
