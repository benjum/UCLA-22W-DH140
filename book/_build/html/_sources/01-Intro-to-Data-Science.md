## Data Science: What's the hype?

### Brahe, Kepler, and Newton

### Dr. John Snow and Cholera

Dr. Snow was an intern physician when a cholera epidemic broke out in London in the 1830’s.

The germ theory of disease did not exist yet.

Prevailing opinion: cholera was somehow transmitted by bad air, or a “miasma,” that emanated from the sick and from garbage.

* Physicians of the time gave treatments like:
* Arsenic and strychnine
* Tobacco enemas
* Wrap them in flannel soaked in turpentine
* Bleed them with leeches
* Blister them with nitric acid
* Fire cannons every hour to disperse the bad air!

There was a common process here.
1. Gather data
1. Put it into a form that allows one to draw insights
1. Verify the validity of any statements
1. Analyze the data some more
1. Make predictions; formulate a cohesive story
1. Present that story to others
